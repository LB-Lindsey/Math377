    "6. No, just because there is a correlation between the two, you cannot imply causation. Causation and correlation are sepereate entities. Experiments must be run with a control group to establish a medium of comparison. For example, a scientist can analyze a city with high crime and another with histrically low crime rates then raise the ice cream sales of both and analyze what happens. Establishing comparison is a key component of determining causality.\n",

An experiment implies a control group and more manipulation freedom of what is being studied. Experiments yield stronger results becasue of the degree you can compare to a control group."
